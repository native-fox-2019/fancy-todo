TaskList App is a simple web-app to manage your to do list. Not as fancy as you might think, but it works.

Features:

1. You can create, edit, and manage your own tasks.
2. Google Sign-In as alternative.
3. Random quote of the task (QOTT) on the 'Detail' section.


Here's the API documentation: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10571056/SzKbLFEq?version=latest


Questions you might have:

(?) Why is the design so bland?
(!) I restarted the project. Not much time to tinker on the design, but I think it has a decent basic layout.

(?) Do you use a 3rd-party API?
(!) Yes, the random quote generator. Click on the 'detail' button and then click again on the entry. It might take some time to load, though.

(?) Why jQuery?
(!) Yeah, I often ask myself that question too.

(?) Why is there a Google Sign-In? You're expecting someone will use this shitty app?
(!) It's just for practice. No one uses a newbie's to-do list app anyway.


## Usage

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed in your computer, and then run these commands:

```
$ npm install
